Coastal Storms are tropical systems that form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.  People who live in hurricane prone communities should know their vulnerability, and what actions should be taken to reduce the effects of these devastating storms.  They bring strong winds, storm surge, flooding, and tornadoes and combine them in one major event.  They may be called Tropical Storms or Hurricanes based on the intensity of the storm.  For more information on how to prepare for them, visit the coastal storms page at ReadyPhiladelphia.org.
