    </table>    <p>Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms. They can appear suddenly without warning and can be invisible until dust and debris are picked up or a funnel cloud appears. Planning and practicing 
specifically how and where you take shelter is a matter of survival. Be prepared to act quickly.  For more information on how to prepare for them, visit the <a href="http://oem.readyphiladelphi
